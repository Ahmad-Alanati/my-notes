# my-notes

this README has 3 parts, the first one is introduction about myself.

the second one is the summary of the web page you provided, the third one is the summary of today lesson.

# introduction

hello my name is ahmad jehad alanati, my major is CIS(computer inforamtion systems) i graduated for jordan university, i have some experience of programming, i joined jucpc competition to improve my problem solving skills and i have an account on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/ahmad_jehad).

i am planning on taking this coruse to get more experience in web development and to become full-stack developer.

# good-developer-mindset

there is some key point a developer mush master and they are:
1. conceiving the purpose of software: developers should understand that you develop a program to help people not to show of, by understanding the purpose of your software it will help you prioritize functionalty and features.
2. the goals of software design: to design a good software you need to fouces on two keys the first one is the design should be easy for you and the other one is the software should be helpful for the users too.
3. Misunderstanding: Misunderstanding your work tend to developing complex systems and understanding your work will help you on your design.
4. simplicity: programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity.
what is the difference between good and bad developer?
good developers trying they best to make their code as simple as possible in the other hand bad developer is someone who failed to make their code simple.
the resion why some programmer fall in the bad side is their mindset of thinking complexity code mean that they are intelligent.
5. Complexity: the jop of the programmer is to control their software complexity so they don't fall to the endless days of fixing bugs.
6. Maintenance: one of the main responsibilities of the developer is mainteaning their software.
7. Consistency: keep the formate of your code on your software consistent don't change it in every file.
8. Prioritizing: your decisions must follow some rules and they should be in this equation

    D(The desirability of a change)

    V(The value of a change)

    E(The effort required to perform the change)

    D = V/E

    the highter the value the better the change will be to your software.
9. Solving Problems: there is 3 steps to solve problems

    the first one is understanding.

    the second one is planning.

    the third one is dividing.
10. Good enough is fine: what are the problem chasing perfection do to your projects?
    - You will be writing code that isn’t needed
    - You will increase complexity by adding unnecessary codes
    - You will be too generic
    - You will be missing deadlines
    - You will be dealing with many bugs caused by the complexity

    the way to avoid it is to Start small, improve it, then extend you system.
11. Predictions: developoing generic software will increase the the complexity of you code and you may develop some unneeded code.
12. Assumptions: Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.
13. Stop Reinventing: stop reinventing tools when you have one exists.
the only time you can reinvent is:
    - You need something that doesn’t exist yet
    - All of the existing “wheels” are bad technologies or incapable of handling your needs
    - The existing “wheels” aren’t being properly maintained
14. Resistance: you should stop thinking about adding more code to your software.
15. Automation: don't waste your time on something that can be automated. 
16. Code measurement: don't measure the quality of the code by the number of lines more lines mean more complexity and you should avoid having less code.
17. Productivity: the productivity is measured by how many lines of code you write but how many lines of code you remove.
18. Testing: before you make any changes to the project file you should test your code.
19. UnderEstimation: don't underestimate the time and effort to make a software or you will be missing a lot of deadlines.
20. Running Away From Rewriting: you should stay away for rewriting your code.
21. Documentation and Commenting: commenting should explain why you did something instead of what your code is doing.\
documenting helps new developer who joined your team to understand the software as a whole.
22. Picking Technologies: Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
23. Self-Development: keep learning and Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.
24. Don’t be a hero: Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help:when you face a problem don't ask for help immediately, instead try anything and everything you can think of didn't find a solution, search! Find answers and try them out then understand why they work, adapt them to your code.
But always seek advice from your senior.

# summary of today lesson

## things i learn from today class
how to use the terminal with some of it's commands:
1. pwd: print working directory.
2. mkdir: make directory.
3. cd: change directory.
4. ls:  list. /to list all folders and files on this directory. One of it’s elements is -a and it list all directorys and files and the hidden ones too.
5. Touch: to make a file
6. Nano: terminal text editor.
7. Cat: to print a content of a file. 
8. Tree: to show the files and directory in a tree shape.
9. Clear: to clear screen.
10. Rm: remove file. One of it’s element is -rf (recursively force)it delete recursively.
11. Rmdir: to remove directory.(it must be empty)
12. Explorer.exe: it let’s you open the ubuntu files or directory on windows GUI.

If you see a . before a name of file or directory that 
means it is hidden.

## Characteristics of CLI:
1.	Multitasking.
2.	Hard to master all commands.

## Characteristics of GUI:
1.	Easier to use for new users.

## what is VCS (version control system)?
It is a tool that help you control your files for the programs so if there is and error on the new version of you program so you can retrieve your files back to where there isn’t a problem with it.

## what are the advantages of VCS?
1. backup and recovery.
2. collaboration with a team member.
3. tracking changes.
4. branching and merging.

## how to use VCS tools like git and github
clone command: git clone SSH link\
add command: git add\
commit command: git commit -m"type a description"\
push command: git push origin main
### ACP is add, commit, push.
